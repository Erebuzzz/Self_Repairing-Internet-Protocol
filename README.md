# Simulating-a-Self-Repairing-Internet-Protocol-to-Prevent-Network-Failures 
The project aims to develop a simulation-based framework for a self-repairing 
internet protocol that dynamically detects, predicts, and mitigates network failures using 
adaptive routing mechanisms, machine learning-based failure prediction, and self-healing 
techniques. 

Problem Statement: The internet plays a crucial role in global communication, yet network 
failures remain a significant challenge, causing downtime, slow performance, and disruptions 
in services. Traditional routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP 
(Border Gateway Protocol) help maintain connectivity, but they struggle to adapt to failures 
in real-time. Network failures can cause significant disruptions in communication, leading to 
downtime, increased latency, and potential security risks. Traditional network protocols such 
as OSPF and BGP are limited in their adaptability to real-time failure conditions, requiring 
manual interventions or predefined routing adjustments. This project explores a dynamic and 
intelligent approach to autonomously handling network failures.

Methodology: 
1. Network Simulation Setup: 
o Utilize tools like NetworkX and Dash to create a graphical and interactive 
simulation environment. 
o Implement a topology generation system using real-world network structures. 
2. Real-Time Monitoring & Adaptive Routing: 
o Develop an event-driven monitoring module that continuously analyzes link 
and node stability. 
o Implement BGP-like topology updates that dynamically adjust based on 
routing table changes and link failures. 
o Enforce autonomous system (AS) path policies to simulate internet-scale 
routing behaviors. 
3. Machine Learning-Based Failure Prediction: 
o Implement a lightweight Q-learning-based failure predictor that learns from 
historical network conditions. 
o Train reinforcement learning agents to optimize routing decisions 
dynamically. 
o Introduce multi-agent Q-learning to improve global scalability and 
decentralized decision-making. 
4. Self-Healing Network Mechanism: 
o Design a proactive rerouting mechanism based on failure predictions. 
o Introduce redundancy mechanisms such as alternate paths and congestion
aware load balancing. 
o Implement a dynamic QoS-aware routing system that prioritizes critical traffic 
under failure conditions. 
5. Integration of BGP Hijack Detection:
o Leverage RIPE RIS Live API to detect BGP hijack incidents and integrate 
protective countermeasures. 
o Implement anomaly detection algorithms to classify malicious routing 
behaviors. 

Expected Outcomes: 
o A working proof-of-concept that demonstrates the feasibility of a self-repairing 
internet protocol. 
o A simulation environment showcasing real-time failure predictions, adaptive 
rerouting, and self-healing capabilities. 
o Improved fault tolerance and resilience compared to traditional network protocols. 
o Insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting and mitigating 
network failures.

Challenges & Considerations: 
o Real-time adaptability and scalability to large-scale networks. 
o Balancing the trade-off between dynamic rerouting and stability. 
o Ensuring the security and integrity of self-adjusting routing decisions. 

Future Work: If successful, the project can be extended to: 
o More advanced reinforcement learning techniques (Deep Q-Networks, Multi-Agent 
RL). 
o Large-scale deployment using real-world traffic data. 
o Enhanced security mechanisms against routing attacks.

Conclusion: This project will demonstrate a novel approach to enhancing internet resilience 
through intelligent, self-repairing mechanisms, improving reliability and reducing downtime 
in global-scale networks.
